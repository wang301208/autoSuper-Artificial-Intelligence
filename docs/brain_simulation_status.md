# Brain Simulation Status

## Current Coverage
- `modules/brain/whole_brain.py` now wires the cortical loop to the deeper precision motor hierarchy. The default simulation instantiates `PrecisionMotorSystem`, shares its basal ganglia gate with the cortical planner, and feeds neuromorphic modulators (novelty/emotion/oscillation/learning load) through a persistent backend before actions are scheduled.
- `modules/brain/motor_cortex.py` accepts raw spike sequences or cached neuromorphic run results, converts them into structured `MotorCommand` objects, and layers both cortical and precision cerebellar fine tuning during execution.
- `modules/brain/neuromorphic/spiking_network.py` exposes a bounded `reset_state` helper and caps event propagation to avoid runaway excitations while keeping energy and synchrony telemetry intact.
- `modules/tests/test_whole_brain.py` covers the full closed loop—oscillation metrics, basal ganglia gating history, neuromorphic energy/synchrony output, and direct motor cortex handling of pre-computed spike results.

## Gaps Against "完整的大脑模拟+神经形态"
- Neuromorphic runs still rely on capped event queues rather than adaptive convergence criteria; long-running dynamics remain approximated.
- Precision motor learning is fed with aggregate energy snapshots—richer reward/error channels are still TODO.
- The oscillation module contributes modulation metrics but is not yet bidirectionally coupled to neuromorphic weights or plasticity persistence.

## Implementation Starting Point
1. Investigate adaptive stopping criteria or lightweight recurrent weight decay so the bounded event loop can be relaxed without risking infinite cascades.
2. Extend precision cerebellar learning to ingest actuator telemetry and environment feedback, closing the loop for error-driven tuning.
3. Persist neuromorphic modulation history (energy, synchrony, strategy weights) for cross-cycle adaptation and dashboarding.
4. Stage follow-up work: multi-region memory consolidation, plasticity checkpoints, and dataset-driven tuning of oscillation/neuromorphic parameters.
