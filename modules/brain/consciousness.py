"""Simplified consciousness model components.

This module implements a tiny collection of classes that mimic
fundamental pieces of a cognitive architecture.  They are intentionally
lightâ€‘weight and only provide behaviour required by the unit tests:

``GlobalWorkspace``
    Records broadcasts of salient information.
``AttentionController``
    Evaluates whether a piece of information is salient.
``FeatureBinding``
    Placeholder that returns the information unchanged.
``ConsciousnessModel``
    Integrates the above components and exposes ``conscious_access``.
