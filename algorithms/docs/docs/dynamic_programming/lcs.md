**Purpose:** Find the length of the longest sequence present in two strings.

**Input:**
- `s1`: first string
- `s2`: second string

**Output:** Length of the longest common subsequence as `int`.

## Example
```python
from algorithms.dynamic_programming.basic.lcs import LongestCommonSubsequence

LongestCommonSubsequence().execute("abcde", "ace")
```
Output:
```
3
```
