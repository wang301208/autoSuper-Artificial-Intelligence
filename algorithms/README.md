# Algorithm Library

This directory contains algorithm implementations organized by category
and difficulty.

## Language & Style
- Implement algorithms in **Python 3**.
- Follow the **PEP 8** style guide.

## Interface & Naming
- Use the `Algorithm` base class in `base.py`.
- Classes use `PascalCase`.
- Functions and methods use `snake_case`.
- Module and package names use `snake_case`.

## Directory Structure
Algorithms are grouped by their function (e.g., `sorting`, `searching`)
and then by difficulty (`basic`, `advanced`).

```
algorithms/
├── sorting/
│   ├── basic/
│   └── advanced/
└── searching/
    ├── basic/
    └── advanced/
```

Use `template.py` as a starting point for new algorithm implementations.
